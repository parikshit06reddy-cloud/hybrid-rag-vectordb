"""Weaviate JSON indexing pipeline for LangChain.

This module provides the indexing pipeline for JSON document storage using Weaviate
as the vector store backend. Weaviate offers a knowledge graph-enhanced vector
database with native JSON property support and semantic relationships.

The indexing pipeline follows the standard three-phase pattern:
1. Document loading via DataloaderCatalog (supports multiple dataset types)
2. Embedding generation using configurable embedders
3. Vector store indexing with collection management

JSON Indexing Pattern:
    - Text content extracted from JSON for embedding
    - Full JSON structure preserved as properties
    - Nested JSON fields mapped to Weaviate properties
    - Enables both semantic search and structured filtering

Weaviate-specific Implementation:
    - Cloud-native or self-hosted deployment options
    - Native JSON property storage with typed schema
    - Collection-based document organization (Weaviate classes)
    - GraphQL-based querying with filter support
    - Automatic vectorization or bring-your-own embeddings

Use Cases:
    - Knowledge graphs with semantic relationships
    - Enterprise search with access control
    - Multi-modal search applications
    - Connected data with relationship traversal

    """Weaviate indexing pipeline for JSON documents (LangChain).

    Loads JSON documents, generates embeddings for text content, creates
    collection, and indexes documents with preserved JSON structure as properties.

    Leverages Weaviate's schema-based approach to store JSON structures as
    typed properties, enabling powerful filtering and GraphQL-based queries
    during search operations.

    Attributes:
        config: Loaded and validated configuration dictionary.
        embedder: Configured embedding model for document vectorization.
        db: WeaviateVectorDB instance for vector storage operations.
        collection_name: Target Weaviate collection (class) for document storage.

    Example:
        >>> config = {
        ...     "dataloader": {"type": "triviaqa", "split": "test"},
        ...     "embeddings": {"model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"},

        ...         "collection_name": "JsonDocs",
        ...     },
        ... }
