# Diversity Filtering

Result diversification for retrieval pipelines that ensures retrieved documents cover a broad range of topics rather than returning near-duplicate or narrowly focused results. By removing redundant documents and selecting representatives from distinct content clusters, the diversity filtering step produces a result set that balances relevance to the query with coverage of different perspectives.

This module is particularly valuable when queries could be answered from multiple angles or when the knowledge base contains overlapping content. Instead of returning five documents that all say the same thing, diversity filtering ensures the result set covers distinct aspects of the topic.

## Overview

- Uses Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) as the default diversity strategy
- Supports clustering-based diversity selection using KMeans
- Retrieves a larger candidate set, then filters down to diverse representatives
- Configurable `lambda_param` to balance relevance and diversity for MMR
- Configurable `candidate_multiplier` to control over-fetching (default: 3x)
- Optional clustering parameters for topic-coverage-oriented retrieval
- Works with all five vector databases using a consistent interface
- Can be combined with RAG for answer generation from diverse sources
- Configuration-driven through YAML files with environment variable substitution

## How It Works

### Indexing Phase

Each database has a dedicated indexing pipeline that loads documents from a configured dataset (such as TriviaQA, ARC, PopQA, FactScore, or Earnings Calls), generates dense embeddings using a sentence transformer model, and writes the embedded documents to the target vector database. The indexing process is identical to standard semantic search indexing.

### Search with Diversity Filtering

The search pipeline first retrieves a broad set of candidate documents using a configurable multiplier (default: 3x `top_k`). By default, it then applies MMR to balance query relevance against redundancy among already-selected documents:

`MMR(d) = lambda * sim(d, query) - (1 - lambda) * max_sim(d, selected)`

Lower `lambda_param` values favor diversity, while higher values favor relevance.

For clustering-based approaches, the pipeline groups documents into topic clusters and selects the most relevant document from each cluster. This ensures the final result set covers multiple distinct topic areas rather than variations of the same content.

### Diversity Strategies

**MMR (default)** balances relevance to the query with novelty against selected results. This is the recommended strategy for RAG retrieval when both relevance and coverage matter.

**Clustering-based selection** groups documents into clusters using KMeans. The pipeline selects representatives near each cluster centroid to ensure topic diversity.

## Supported Databases

| Database | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Pinecone | Supported | Namespace-scoped diversity filtering |
| Weaviate | Supported | Collection-based filtering |
| Chroma | Supported | Works with local and persistent storage |
| Milvus | Supported | Partition-aware filtering |
| Qdrant | Supported | Payload-filtered candidate retrieval |

## Configuration

Configuration is driven by YAML files stored in the `configs/` directory, organized by database and dataset. The configuration controls diversity method parameters and optional RAG generation.

```yaml
pinecone:
  api_key: "${PINECONE_API_KEY}"
  index_name: "diversity-index"
  namespace: ""

embeddings:
  model: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  batch_size: 32

diversity:
  method: "mmr"  # or "clustering"
  max_documents: 10
  lambda_param: 0.5
  candidate_multiplier: 3  # Over-fetch multiplier (default: 3)
  # For clustering method:
  # num_clusters: 3 (default)
  # samples_per_cluster: 2 (default)

search:
  top_k: 10

rag:
  enabled: false
  model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
  api_key: "${GROQ_API_KEY}"
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2048

logging:
  level: "INFO"
```
