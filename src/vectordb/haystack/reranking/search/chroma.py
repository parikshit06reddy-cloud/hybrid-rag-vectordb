"""Chroma reranking search pipeline.

This module provides a search pipeline that combines Chroma's local or server-based
vector similarity search with cross-encoder reranking to improve result quality.

Reranking Fundamentals:
    Reranking addresses a key limitation of vector search: bi-encoders encode
    queries and documents independently, missing query-document interactions.
    Cross-encoders process pairs jointly, capturing nuanced relevance signals.

Two-Stage Retrieval Process:
    1. Bi-encoder embedding → Fast approximate nearest neighbor search in Chroma
    2. Cross-encoder scoring → Precise relevance assessment on top candidates

Retrieval Multiplier:
    The pipeline retrieves 3x the requested top_k to ensure the reranker has
    sufficient candidates. This balances:
    - Coverage: Higher chance of including truly relevant documents
    - Cost: Reranking 3x documents is still much faster than exhaustive search
    - Latency: Acceptable overhead for precision gains

When to Use This Pipeline:
    - High-precision requirements (question answering, semantic search)
    - Local development or self-hosted deployments (Chroma)
    - When latency can tolerate 100-500ms reranking overhead
    - Documents require deep semantic understanding beyond keyword matching

Example:
    >>> pipeline = ChromaRerankingSearchPipeline("config.yaml")
    >>> results = pipeline.search("transformer attention mechanism", top_k=5)
    >>> for doc in results["documents"]:
    ...     print(f"Score: {doc.score}, Content: {doc.content[:100]}...")

class ChromaRerankingSearchPipeline:
    """Chroma search pipeline with cross-encoder reranking.

    Implements two-stage retrieval using Chroma for fast vector similarity
    search and a cross-encoder for precise final ranking. This approach
    delivers high-precision results while maintaining acceptable latency.

    Architecture:
        Stage 1 (Fast): Bi-encoder embeds query; Chroma retrieves 3x candidates
        Stage 2 (Precise): Cross-encoder scores each query-document pair;
        Top K results returned

    Attributes:
        config: Configuration dict with chroma, embedder, and reranker settings.
        embedder: Bi-encoder component for query embedding generation.
        reranker: Cross-encoder component for document scoring and reordering.
        db: ChromaVectorDB instance for document storage and retrieval.
        collection_name: Name of the Chroma collection being searched.

    Performance Characteristics:
        - Vector search: O(log n) with HNSW index (n = document count)
        - Reranking: O(k) where k = 3 * top_k (fixed small number)
        - Total latency: ~50-200ms for vector search + 100-500ms for reranking

        Performs dense retrieval followed by cross-encoder reranking to deliver
        high-precision search results.

        Stage 1 - Dense Retrieval:
            The query is embedded using a bi-encoder, then Chroma's HNSW index
            is queried for approximate nearest neighbors. We retrieve 3x the
            requested top_k to ensure good coverage for reranking.

        Stage 2 - Cross-Encoder Reranking:
            Each candidate document is scored against the query using a cross-
            encoder model. This joint encoding captures semantic nuances missed
            by independent bi-encoder embeddings. Results are sorted by score.

        Args:
            query: Search query text to find relevant documents for.
            top_k: Number of final results to return after reranking.
                The pipeline retrieves 3x this amount initially to maximize
                the chance of finding truly relevant documents.
            filters: Optional metadata filters to apply during vector search.
                Chroma supports filtering on document metadata fields using
                equality, range, and logical operators.

        Returns:
            Dict with 'query' (original query string) and 'documents' (list of
            Document objects sorted by cross-encoder relevance score, highest
            first). Each document includes score, content, and metadata.
