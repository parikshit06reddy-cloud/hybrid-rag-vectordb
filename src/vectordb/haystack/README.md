# Haystack Integration

Pipeline components for building retrieval-augmented generation applications using the Haystack framework across five supported vector databases.

## Overview

This module provides over fifteen advanced RAG features, each implemented as a self-contained pipeline that works with any supported database and dataset combination. The design is configuration-driven: all behavior is parameterized through YAML files, eliminating hardcoded connection strings and feature settings. Each feature follows a consistent two-phase pipeline pattern covering both indexing and search.

> **Note:** Vector database wrapper classes (ChromaVectorDB, MilvusVectorDB, etc.) now live in [`databases/`](../databases/) and are shared by both Haystack and LangChain integrations.

## How It Works

Every feature follows a two-phase pattern:

1. **Indexing phase** - Loads documents from a dataset, generates embeddings (dense, sparse, or both), and stores the resulting vectors in the target database.

2. **Search phase** - Embeds the incoming query, retrieves candidates from the database, applies optional post-processing (reranking, compression, diversification, or filtering), and optionally generates an answer using a large language model.

All behavior is parameterized via YAML configuration files located in each feature's `configs/` subdirectory. For each feature, configuration files cover all supported combinations of five databases and five datasets (TriviaQA, ARC, PopQA, FactScore, and EarningsCall).
