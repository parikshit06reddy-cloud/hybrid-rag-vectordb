# Contributing to VectorDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VectorDB! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your efforts to improve this project.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to VectorDB:

- Submit bug reports or feature requests via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/avnlp/vectordb/issues).
- Fix bugs or implement features via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/avnlp/vectordb/pulls).
- Improve documentation.
- Review existing pull requests.
- Help answer questions from other users.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd vectordb
    ```

    Note: This project requires Python 3.11 or higher.

3. The project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. Ensure uv is installed:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

4. Sync the project and install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    make sync
    ```

    Then activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

     This creates an isolated virtual environment with project dependencies and the project installed in editable mode.

## Code Quality Standards

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
make test
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
make test-cov
```

To run tests with coverage and generate reports:

```bash
make cov
```

To generate coverage reports from existing coverage data:

```bash
make cov-report
```

Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.

### Code Quality

This project uses:

- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting and linting.
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking.

Format and lint your code before submitting:

```bash
make lint-all
```

This command will format code with Ruff, apply auto-fixes with Ruff, and check typing with mypy.
